# commitquality-tests
End-to-end tests for commitquality.com. Used to practice Selenium and test automation.
Note that some code in here might be pretty messy since I'm just using this to learn.
Also note that not all tests are passing since there's some bugs on the pages under test.

Developed on elementaryOS using Pytest and Selenium.
